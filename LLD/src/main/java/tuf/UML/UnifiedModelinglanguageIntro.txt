UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE (UML)
---------------------------------------

UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct,
and document the structure and behavior of software systems.

Think of UML as a toolkit of diagrams that helps software developers and designers map out how a system works,
before or alongside writing the actual code.



Types of UML Diagrams ->

UML diagrams are divided into two main categories, each serving a different purpose in modeling software systems:

1. Structural Diagrams
These describe the static structure of a system — what it contains, how different parts relate to each other, and how data is organized.

They are like the architectural blueprints of the system, showing the foundation, components, and their connections.
Structural diagrams focus on the elements that exist in the system (like classes, objects, and hardware), rather than what happens during execution.

2. Behavioral Diagrams
These describe the dynamic behavior of a system — how it behaves over time, how users interact with it,
and how parts communicate during execution.

They are like the scripts and animations in a movie — showing what happens, when it happens, and who is involved.
Behavioral diagrams focus on actions, interactions, processes, and state changes.





Different Structural Diagrams ->

There are seven main types of structural diagrams in UML, each serving a specific purpose in modeling the static aspects of a system:

Class Diagram: Shows classes, their properties, methods, and relationships — a map of the code structure.
Object Diagram: Shows a snapshot of instances of classes and their relationships at a specific point in time.
Component Diagram: Depicts how software components (modules) are organized and connected.
Composite Structure Diagram: Shows the internal parts of a class and how they interact to carry out behavior.
Deployment Diagram: Illustrates how software is physically deployed onto hardware devices or servers.
Package Diagram: Groups related elements (like classes) into packages for better organization.
Profile Diagram: Used to customize UML for specific platforms or domains by extending its elements.



Different Behavioral Diagrams ->

There are seven main types of behavioral diagrams in UML, each serving a specific purpose in modeling the dynamic aspects of a system:

Use Case Diagram: Captures what users (actors) can do with the system — its high-level functionalities.
Activity Diagram: Models workflows and business processes — similar to flowcharts.
Sequence Diagram: Shows the order of messages exchanged between objects over time.
Communication Diagram: Emphasizes interactions between objects and how they're connected.
State Machine Diagram: Depicts how an object transitions between states based on events.
Interaction Overview Diagram: Combines features of sequence and activity diagrams to model interaction flow.
Timing Diagram: Focuses on object behavior with respect to time, particularly useful for real-time systems.


For LLD we mainly use Class Diagrams.
